		<div class="text"><p>World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the fourth released game set in the Warcraft fantasy universe.</p></div>
		<div  id="p" class="video-wrapper">
		<p  class="text" >
		
		World of Warcraft takes place within the Warcraft world of Azeroth, 
		approximately four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's 
		previous Warcraft release, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.The game was 
		announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft 
		franchise on November 23, 2004. Since launch, World of Warcraft has had eight 
		major expansion packs produced for it: The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, 
		Cataclysm, Mists of Pandaria, Warlords of Draenor, Legion, Battle for Azeroth, and Shadowlands.
		<br><b>Starting a character or play session</b></br>
		As with other MMORPGs, players control a character avatar within a game world in third- or 
		first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and
		interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players.
		To create a new character, in keeping with the storyline of previous Warcraft games, players must
		choose between the opposing factions of the Alliance or the Horde.
		The player selects the new character's race, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves
		for the Alliance. Players must select the class for the character, with choices such as mages
		, warriors, and priests available. Most classes are limited to particular races.
		As characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player
		to further define the abilities of that character.
		While a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more
		challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in a way that they can only be 
		overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group.

		<div  id="p1" class="video-wrapper">
		<p class="text" >
		
		The title is a direct sequel to 2015's Ori and the Blind Forest, and was released on March 11,
		2020 for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows.
		The game was developed by Moon Studios, a collective organization without a set location. 
		The game's visuals were given an overhaul from the two-dimensional artwork in Blind Forest, 
		to the three-dimensional models played in multilayered backgrounds in Will of the Wisps.
		<br><b>Gameplay</b></br>
		Players assume control of Ori, a white guardian spirit. As Ori, players must jump, climb,
		glide, and swim between various platforms to solve intricate puzzles. Gameplay unfolds in 
		the form of a Metroidvania, with new abilities and upgrades allowing players to unlock 
		previously inaccessible areas of the map.
		<br><b>The story</b> takes place immediately after the events of Blind Forest and is narrated by 
		the Spirit Tree in the forest of Niwen. Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby 
		owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and raise as part of their family. Being born with 
		a damaged wing, Ku is unable to fly until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to it. Ku and Ori 
		go on a flight that ends up taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm separates them.

		Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several 
		countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are
		assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having 
		five players on it. Agents have unique abilities each requiring charges, as 
		well as a unique ultimate ability which requires charging through kills, deaths, 
		or spike actions. Each player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and with 
		one or more "signature ability" charge. Other weapons and ability charges can be 
		purchased using an in game economic system which awards money based on the outcome 
		of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any actions 
		taken with the spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including sidearms, 
		submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.
		<br><b>Standard</b></br>
		In the standard mode, the match is played as best of 25 - first team to win 13
		rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike,
		which they must deliver to a specified location and activate. If the attacking team 
		successfully protects the activated Spike for a set time, it detonates and they receive
		a point. If the defending team is able to deactivate the spike, or the 100-second 
		round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending 
		team receives a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike 
		is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is 
		activated, the opposing team earns a point.
		<br><b>Spike Rush</b></br>
		In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win
		4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except
		their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games.
		<br><b>Competitive</b></br>
		Competitive matches are the same as standard matches with the addition of a win-based 
		ranking system which assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played.

		<div class="text"><p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. Created by
		Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language andthe game was officially released in 
		November 2011.Minecraft has since been ported to various platforms and become the best-selling

		In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, 
		and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or 
		earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as
		cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival
		mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, 
		and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game 
		to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
		<br><b>Gameplay</b></br>
		When starting a new world, players must choose one of five game modes, as well as one of 
		four difficulties, ranging from peaceful to hard. Increasing the difficulty of the game causes
		the player to take more damage from mobs, as well as having other difficulty-specific effects.
		New players have a randomly selected default character skin of either Steve or Alex, but the
		option to create custom skins was made available in 2010. Players encounter various non-player 
		characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures. Passive mobs,
		such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials.
		They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, skeletons, 
		and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves.
		Players can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft. Craftable items include armor,
		which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords), which allows monsters and
		animals to be killed more easily; and tools, which break certain types of blocks more quickly.

		<b>Gameplay</b></br>
		The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. 
		Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. 
		The Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, 
		while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or 
		rescue the hostages. There are nine game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific 
		to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve 
		servers, as well as allowing members of the community to host their own servers with custom maps and
		game modes.
		There are five categories of purchasable weapons, four being guns and the final being utilities: 
		rifles, sub-machine guns (SMGs), heavy, pistols, and grenades. All guns have different properties and 
		all grenade types have different in-game effects. The hand grenade (HE) deals damage in a small radius,
		the smoke grenade temporarily places a smoke screen, the decoy grenade emulates the player's primary gun, 
		the flashbang temporarily blinds players who look towards it when it explodes, and the Molotov cocktail 
		and Incendiary Grenade set a small part of the map on fire for a short period of time. Alongside all 
		of the main weapons, the Zeus x27, a taser, can also be purchased.

		<div class="text"><p>Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North

		Grand Theft Auto IV. </p></div>
		<div  id="p5" class="video-wrapper">
		<p class="text" >
		
		Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story
		follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, 
		and drug dealer and arms smuggler Trevor Philips—and their efforts to commit heists while under 
		pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful crime figures.
		The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle.
		<br><b>Gameplay</b></br>
		Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use
		vehicles to navigate the world. To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types
		absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft. In combat, auto-aim 
		and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their 
		health meter will gradually regenerate to its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when 
		their health depletes. If players commit crimes, law enforcement agencies may respond as
		indicated by a "wanted" meter in the head-up display (HUD). Stars displayed on the meter 
		indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star level, police helicopters 
		and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players). Law enforcement officers will search for
		players who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when 
		players are hidden from the officers' line of sight that displays on the mini-map.

		In League of Legends, players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities and battle
		against a team of other player- or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy 
		the opposing team's Nexus, a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive 
		structures, although other distinct game modes exist as well with varying objectives, rules, and maps. 
		Champions span a variety of roles and blend a variety of fantasy tropes, tied to a fictional 
		universe developed by Riot Games through short stories, comics, cinematics, and books.
		<br><b>Gameplay</b></br>
		League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in the three-dimensional isometric perspective.
		In all game modes, players control characters called champions who each have a set of unique abilities.
		Players chose or are assigned champions before the start of every match. Champions begin every match
		at a low level, and then can gain experience over the course of the match to increase their level, 
		with the maximum being 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their 
		champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. 
		If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated but are automatically revived in their
		base after enough time passes.
		Across matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played.

		Players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources
		that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to 
		build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to 
		add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be 
		updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within Save the World this 
		enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels 
		to lure husks through. In Battle Royale, this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, 
		protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very 
		inventive in designing their fortifications in Creative.

		<div class="text"><p>Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, 
		Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The game is a part of the 2019 title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare but does not 
		require purchase of it. Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software and published by Activision.</p></div>
		<div  id="p8" class="video-wrapper">
		<p class="text" >
		
		Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some limited-time game modes 
		support 200 players. Codenamed Operation: Rapid Sunder, it is set in the fictional city of Verdansk
		, which is loosely based on Donetsk city in Eastern Ukraine, on day 96 of the ongoing in-game 
		conflict. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between both games.
		The game features two main modes: Plunder and Battle Royale. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency 
		system called "Cash" which is used at "Buy Stations" in and around Verdansk. "Loadout" drops are 
		an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes (which are shared
		with Modern Warfare's standard modes). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as 
		"killstreaks" and gas masks. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players.
		However, in free post launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added to the game.
		<br><b>Gameplay</b></br>
		The Battle Royale mode is similar to other titles in the genre where players compete in a continuously 
		shrinking map to be the last player remaining. Players parachute onto a large game map, where they 
		encounter other players. As the game progresses and players are eliminated, the playable area shrinks 
		forcing the remaining players into tighter spaces. In Warzone, the non-playable areas become 
		contaminated with a green gas that depletes health and eventually kills the player if they do not 
		return to the safe playable area. Unlike other titles, Warzone introduces a new respawn mechanic, 
		a greater emphasis on vehicles, and a new in-game currency mechanic. Parachuting is unrestricted, 
		with the player being allowed to open and cut their parachute an unlimited number of times while in air.

		<b>Gameplay</b></br>
		Up to 60 players join a match in battle royale-style gameplay. Players, represented as jellybean-like figures,
		move around a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such as jumping, grabbing, or diving to assist gameplay.
		The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully completing each of the randomized pre-selected mini-games.
		Certain mini-games involve running towards a finish line at the end of the map, while others add elements of teamwork.
		On every mini-game, obstacles appear around the map for added complexity. Players who are too slow or who fail certain requirements
		for a mini-game are eliminated. On the final round, the remaining few players compete in a final match with a randomized 
		mini-game designed for a smaller player size. The winner of the match is the last player standing.
